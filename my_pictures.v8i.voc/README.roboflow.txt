The dataset includes 148 images.
Chips2 are annotated in Pascal VOC format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (reflect edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random shear of between -5째 to +5째 horizontally and -8째 to +8째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2 pixels
